### Teslatron controller

This Python tool is made for controlling the Teslatron system at the University of Geneva Department of Quantum Materials Physics.

The aim of the tool is to extend the capabilities of the instrument beyond the existing labview program by:
- allowing simultaneous measurement from many voltmeters
- allowing temperature sweeps by sweeping heater power directly
- giving the ability to write more complicated measurement programs through a script

The tool is currently at an early stage of development.
